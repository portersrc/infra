Keys are generated with something like:
    $ COSIGN_PASSWORD=just1testing2password3 cosign generate-key-pair

Then upload them manually to the github repo's secrets. Name them like so:
    COSIGN_PASSWORD
    COSIGN_PRIVATE_KEY
    COSIGN_PUBLIC_KEY

Also a good tutorial is here, though the approach is a little more autoamted
and has a keener eye towards real-world usage:
  https://dev.to/n3wt0n/sign-your-container-images-with-cosign-github-actions-and-github-container-registry-3mni
The key-generation step would be more like the following, which automatically
uploads the public key, private key, and key secret to the github repo:
    $ GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_... \
    COSIGN_PASSWORD=just1testing2password3 \
    cosign generate-key-pair github://portersrc/infra
This may be a better realistic case, but it puts the private key in a github
secret, and I want to just keep it open and readable in the infra repo for
testing purposes.
